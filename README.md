# Unbeatable Tic Tac Toe

An unbeatable implementation of tic tac toe written in Javascript, HTML, and CSS

## Overview

This is a single player tic tac toe game that the user can play against the computer. The game works exactly how a normal tic tac toe game works, but the player can never win. In order to achieve this, the minimax algorithm was implemented. The minimax algorithm is an algorithm that allows for an AI to make optimal moves based on the current game board. Since the algorithm is implemented properly, the result of each game can only be a tie or a win for the computer. This project also helped me practice basic web design concepts and improve my Javascript, HTML, and CSS skills.

## Features and How To Play

In this game the player will make the first move, and then the computer and player will alternate moves after that. The player will be 'X' and the computer will be 'O'. To make a move, just click on the square that you would like to place an 'X' in. An 'X' will appear in the selected square, and then the computer will place an 'O' wherever it decides to. When a move results either a win, loss, or a tie, a window will pop up in the middle of the screen stating the results of the game. From there, the 'Play Again' button can be pressed to play another round. The player's wins, computer's wins, and the ties will be tracked and displayed on the screen under the game board. There is also a drop down menu above the top right square of the game board. The menu contains two buttons: 'Reset' and 'New Round'. The 'Reset' button resets the game board, and also resets the win and tie counts at the bottom of the screen. The 'New Round' button just resets the game board. There is also a turn indicator above the top left portion of the game board that displays whether it is the player's turn to make a move or the computer's turn.
